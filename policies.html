    <h1>Policies</h1>
  
    <h2>Contracts</h2>
    <p>
      Each project or working agreement is governed by a contract between Web Advocate and its clients.  Specific
      policies are spelled out within the contract, but in general, the policies on this page are applied.
    </p>
  
    <h2>Payments</h2>
    <p>
      Projects with fixed prices are usually billed in 3 installments.  The first installment is 30% and is due
      before work begins.  The second 30% is due upon "proof" on "concept" approval.  The final 40% is due upon
      project completion.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Projects or work that is billed hourly will be invoiced weekly or monthly, depending on the project.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Refunds</h2>
    <p>
      The first payment is considered a deposit and is non-refundable. Additionally, refunds are not given for work
      that has been completed according to the contract.  The rights and methods for disputing a charge are given
      in the contract governing the project.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Cancellation</h2>
    <p>
      Rules governing cancellation are given in the contract.  In general, clients may cancel a contract or work
      agreement at any time.  Clients are responsible for paying for all work completed (which may be computed on
      a "percentage or work complete" scale or an hourly scale, depending on project.)  See the section on Refunds,
      above.
